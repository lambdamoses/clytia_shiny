# Clytiapedia
This is a Shiny app to explore a particular Clytia scRNA-seq data. 
You can use it plot PCA, tSNE, and UMAP dimension reductions of the dataset, 
and color the cells by cluster, gene expression, number of total genes, number of UMIs, and cell density on the plot.
You can also plot [RNA velocity](http://velocyto.org) with this app. 
You can also customize the plots, make the plots interactive, and save the static plots. 
(Interactive mode and saving plots are not supported for RNA velocity plots yet; those will be supported with the next release of `velocyto.R`)
